# Final-Project
## **Project Requirements:** 
Students will complete a final project involving the use of RShiny to build an interactive web
application for data analysis and visualization. The project will include a written report and a
presentation.

## **Project Description:**
For our project, we will create a map of food banks across America and add an additonal dimension through food insecurity data to visualize the impact of resources on food insecurity geographically. Through our application, we aim to highlight and bring attention to food insecurity that many Americans face to demonstrate the need for food banks, or further resources.
